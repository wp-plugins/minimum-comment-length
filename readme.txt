Check the comment for a set minimum length and disapprove it if it's too short.

== Description ==

Don't you find it annoying when someone comments with just a smiley? Or a "thanks"? On quite a few forums you have to leave a comment with a minimum of 15 characters to be able to comment, but WordPress doesn't allow you to set such a threshold. With this plugin, it does. It easily checks the comment for a set minimum length and disapprove it if it's too short (except if you're the admin).

More info:

* [Minimum Comment Length](http://yoast.com/wordpress/minimum-comment-length/).
* Check out the other [Wordpress plugins](http://yoast.com/wordpress/) by the same author.

== Installation ==

Installation is easy:

* Download the plugin.
* Copy the folder `minimum-comment-length` to the plugins directory of your blog.
* Enable the plugin in your admin panel.

Optional:

* An options panel will appear under Options.
* Decide on which comment length you'd like to block and what error to throw when a comment is too short.
